Why is the coalition here? (random): I'll be honest for you, probably because some of the crew wanted to step onto solid land for once, eh?

What to say after the job is canceled: Bugger. Let me know if you change your mind, mate. 
Why is the coalition here? (random): I'm guessing a furphy would be that the ship got stuck on some rock and that we had to dock. Nothing against the place though.

Why is the coalition here? (random): I told the admiral to stop by this island because I needed a bathroom break.
Why is the coalition here? (to help): I think it's because someone fell and wanted some help getting back up, but that may be the short story.
