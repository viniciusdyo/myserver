Message_0_Page_0 Well, the <color=uncommon>Ensigns</color> work for the <color=rare>Lieutenants</color>, who both work for me. So if you need me, you'll need everyone else too, and vice-versa - if you need an <color=uncommon>Ensign</color>, I won't be able to get what you need. They tend to hang out with themselves in case you're wondering.
