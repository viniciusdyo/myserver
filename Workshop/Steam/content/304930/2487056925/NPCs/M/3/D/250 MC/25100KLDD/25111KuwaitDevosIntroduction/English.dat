Message_0_Page_0 Nice to meet ya! I'm <name_npc>, and I'm heading this international force called the <color=legendary>Coalition</color> - though, seems like that you already know that.
Message_0_Page_1 Seeing how much you've done here, as well as what I've heard from the <color=legendary>Concord</color>, you seem quite competent in your leadership - so I suppose that'll make you a <color=epic>Major</color> in our ranks.
Message_0_Page_2 Though, implementing a new major would be a bit of a logistical nightmare - I suppose you can be an honorary major, so you can access the resources if you need them. If you've got any burning questions, feel free to let me know!
