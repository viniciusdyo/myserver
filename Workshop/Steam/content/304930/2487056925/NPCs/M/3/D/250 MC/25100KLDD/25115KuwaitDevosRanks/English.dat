Message_0_Page_0 Ah, the ranks? Uhm, let me get the exact notebook real fast...<pause><br><i>Not the back pocket, where did I put it?</i><br>Right, here it is:
Message_0_Page_1 There are three main ranks to climb:<br><color=epic>Major</color> - Leader of a squad<br><color=rare>Lieutenant</color> - Deputy to a <color=epic>Major</color><br><color=uncommon>Ensign</color> - Soldier in a squad
Message_0_Page_2 Beyond that are the core members of the Coalition:<br><color=legendary>Admiral</color> - Heads of state strategizing our global offensive, like <color=legendary>Admiral Isch</color> here<br><color=legendary>Captain</color> - Leader of a contingent, such as myself<br><color=legendary>Commander</color> - Right hand of a <color=legendary>Captain</color>, like Haider here
Message_0_Page_3 Though, seems that these ranks don't exactly translate directly to the ranks that the <color=legendary>Concord</color> has, but they're quite close.
