Message_0_Page_0 Let us get started then, <name_char>. I have heard of how effective you have been in rescuing those still on the mainland. Your strength is exactly what is needed. I will need you to make contact with a group of survivors, and make sure that they are not hostile. If they aren't hostile, we can have a strong foothold on the mainland.
Message_0_Page_1 This task will be quite difficult, as I have had reports that these survivors are particularly ruthless when it comes to outsiders. Unlike zombies, these survivors have brains. Who knows how strong they might be. I am sure someone of your skills can do this.
Message_0_Page_2 I will inform the rest of <color=legendary>Concord</color> and let them know that you will need gear for this. Talk to them and they'll give you some gear in order to get this done.
