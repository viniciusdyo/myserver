Message_0_Page_0 <color=epic>Phillip</color> was one of the guards back at our base - scary one, that fellow. Nice guy though. <color=epic>Cynthia</color>, from what I know, was one of the better soldiers that was with <color=legendary>Snow</color> during their operations. She's got an affinity for handling weaponry it seems.
