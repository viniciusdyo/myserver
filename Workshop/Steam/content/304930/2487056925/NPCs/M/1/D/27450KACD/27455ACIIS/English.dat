Message_0_Page_0 <color=legendary>Issac</color> and <color=legendary>Snow</color> were the main leads for our forces. As the outbreak grew worse, the military soon caved due to infection from the inside. I was with <color=legendary>Issac</color> as we fled the base, as the outbreak was intentionally spread within.
Message_0_Page_1 Soon after, we met back up. We escaped the infection to this island here, so we're using it as a camp. <color=legendary>Issac</color> leads in main operations, while <color=legendary>Snow</color> works primarily in logistics for the base.
Message_0_Page_2 You won't get that many jobs from <color=legendary>Issac</color>, but the ones that you get will be quite difficult. <color=legendary>Snow</color> will always have jobs for you, but they'll be quite tedious.
