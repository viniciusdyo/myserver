Message_0_Page_0 I've been working on making some weapons a bit more compact, so they're easier to use. Think you can bring me a <color=rare>Viper</color>?
Message_1_Page_0 I've been trying to get handguns a bit more controllable. Think you can bring me a <color=rare>Catalyst</color> and a <color=rare>Vertical Grip</color>?
Message_2_Page_0 I've always wondered why it wasn't possible to put a silencer on a shotgun. Think you can bring me a <color=rare>Vonya</color>?
Message_3_Page_0 Nothing interesting, yet. Maybe later, yeah?
