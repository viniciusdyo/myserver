Message_0_Page_0 Welcome to the <color=legendary>Concord</color>, <name_char>. I'm <name_npc>, and I lead this alliance together with <color=legendary>Brigadier Snow</color> here.  
Message_0_Page_1 We're just a group of surviving military forces.. We plan to protect those who seek shelter from whatever it may be, living or dead, as well band together to reclaim our grounds from those threats.
Message_0_Page_2 You can talk to <color=epic>Augustus</color> on the west side of the island for more info. If you're looking for something to do, you can ask <color=legendary>Snow</color> here, or talk to the various people around base - I'm sure they'll appreciate the help!
