Message_0_Page_0 Rula? <pause> Well, I guess I want to know too badly...
Message_0_Page_1 Rula is a government contractor. They design and make high tech equipment. Some of their stuff even hit the consumer shelves.
Message_0_Page_2 Well, before everybody started turning.
Message_0_Page_3 Anyways, when the infection started spreading across the world, Rula suddenly got pulled out of basically every project and moved to some classified stuff.
Message_0_Page_4 They even flat out stopped responding. <pause> Spooky stuff.
Message_0_Page_5 Wait, how does somebody like <color=uncommon>Jack</color> even know about Rula?
Message_0_Page_6 Even <color=legendary>Colonel Jourdan</color> had a hard time getting any information relating to it!
Message_0_Page_7 Man, everything about Rula is just weird. I just hope everybody in there is fine. Just tell me what you find in there, alright?

Response_0 Thanks. I'll tell you if I find anything.
