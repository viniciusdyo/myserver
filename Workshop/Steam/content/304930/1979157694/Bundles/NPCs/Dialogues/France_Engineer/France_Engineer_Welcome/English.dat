Message_0_Page_0 You should go talk to <color=legendary>Colonel Jourdan</color> first, he should be on the second story balcony.
Message_1_Page_0 Hey, so I took a look at the bayonet mounted on the musket.
Message_1_Page_1 I measured it out and experimented, and I think I got the dimensions right.
Message_1_Page_2 So, here's a blueprint for you, so you can make your own bayonets and mount them on whatever guns you want.
Message_2_Page_0 I have something interesting for you!
Message_2_Page_1 I've been messing around with boring barrels and drilling optic mounts.
Message_2_Page_2 This Single Shot Shotgun has an extended barrel and a dot sight.
Message_2_Page_3 You can keep it. I can make replacements for you too! The shotgun itself is pretty simple as well.
Message_3_Page_0 I have... something that may be of some use to you...? Maybe?
Message_3_Page_1 I managed to design a 4-Barreled shotgun that fires 2 rounds from each barrel.
Message_3_Page_2 It lets you fire multiple shells quickly, but it's not as good as something like a <color=legendary>Vanguard</color>.
Message_3_Page_3 Just... don't expect this abomination to save your life, okay?
Message_4_Page_0 I have made another upgraded weapon!
Message_4_Page_1 I was messing around with that Ace you got me, and I added some mounting points to it.
Message_4_Page_2 It now has a 3x scope! It should be a nice hunting pistol now.
Message_4_Page_3 If you put a muffler on it you can pretend to be a special agent!
Message_4_Page_4 ...or you could use a <color=rare>Corsican</color>...
Message_4_Page_5 And I can make another one for you in case you loose it.
Message_5_Page_0 I finally figured out what to do to that musket you got me.
Message_5_Page_1 I rifled the barrel, and it shoots much straighter.
Message_5_Page_2 Now that the musket can actually hit something, I added a 7x scope.
Message_5_Page_3 Keep it. As usual, I can make a replacement.
Message_5_Page_4 Now, I have the skills I need to make firearms.
Message_5_Page_5 However, I need your help.
Message_5_Page_6 I lack the tools and the blueprints.
Message_5_Page_7 Just tell me when you are ready.
Message_6_Page_0 So, I've just brewed something up.
Message_6_Page_1 <color=legendary>Colonel Jourdan</color> says you can have this now, so here it is.
Message_6_Page_2 Here's step-by-step instructions for making some napalm.
Message_6_Page_3 It holds less fuel than standard tanks, not as potent, and it doesn't shoot as far, but still: Homemade Napalm.
Message_7_Page_0 <color=legendary>Colonel Jourdan</color> wants to talk to you, by the way.
Message_7_Page_1 Anyways, what's up?
Message_8_Page_0 What can I do for you?

Response_34 Can you make a weapon for me?
Response_35 Can I ask you a few questions?
Response_36 <color=uncommon>Jack</color> asked me to find a <color=legendary>Solar Charger</color>. He said you know about some Rula Facility?
Response_37 I went to Rula. The place is flooded, completely destroyed.
Response_38 I'll pick it up later.
Response_39 I have to get going.
