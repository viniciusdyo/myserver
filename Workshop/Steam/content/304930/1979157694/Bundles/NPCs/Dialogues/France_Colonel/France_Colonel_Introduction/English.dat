Message_0_Page_0 Well, welcome to the fort, <name_char>. Keep in mind all my men are armed, so think twice before doing anything. 
Message_0_Page_1 We're here after <i>something</i> happened in the Marseille Safezone. All we know is the location has been irradiated, and my remaining men piled into a Maelstrom and fled.
Message_0_Page_2 We managed to pick up a few survivors along the way.
Message_0_Page_3 We are barely surviving, and we could probably help each other out.
