Name Rula Note - Flamethrower success and new projects

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Rula Buisness Log: Dec. 22
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 About a month later, the French Military has given us satisfactory marks on the flamethrower weapon. The few complaints about the weapon stems from the nature of flamethrowers, so sadly we cannot solve this problem. The fire is very effective at disinfection.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_4 The new XE-564 project is showing more progress than the XE-540 project. The XE-564 has better results when using the same power cell, so I'm shutting down XE-540.
