Interactability_Text_Line_2 Today, I woke up to an explosion followed by mass chaos. Soldiers informed us that the city was becoming more and more irradiated. With the explosion catching the troops off-guard, the infected breached in and stormed the city. The last hope for France is now gone. I'm not sure where I am going to go now, just gonna see how long I can survive - I guess..
