Name Rula Note - Unknown Interests

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Rula Event Log: Feb. 12
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 Today, something rather interesting happened. There was a knock on  the top hatch, but when we opened it to investigate, there was nobody there, but just a note left behind, and it reads as follows:	
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_4 We know what you are making down there. We are interested in this new weapon, and we would like to buy it from you. Whatever the French Government is paying you, we'll double it. Don't make us execute plan B.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_6 The staff is a little shaken up by this, but I doubt these people could do much harm.
