Interactability_Text_Line_0 Rula Staff Log: Feb. 22
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 We've gotten reports of one of our agents had his plane crash up North. He appears to have survived the crash landing, but that's the only good news. 
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_4 The Western weapon prototype he recovered has been lost in the crash, as the belly baggage compartment was completely destroyed. A bit of a shame for the operation to fail now.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_6 Another issue is the disguise the agent used. His disguise was based on the idea of a tourist caught in the middle of an infection, not a plane crash survivor. His fake character would realistically not be able to survive and escape such an event. At least he's okay, but now he's attracted a bit too much attention to come back inside.
