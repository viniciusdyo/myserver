Name Rula Note - Government Orders

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Rula Buisness Log: Oct. 24
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 The French Government has approached us with an urgent order. We are to develop and mass produce weapons that excel at the elimination of infected.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Funds for research and development have already been transferred to our accounts, and all other projects excluding the nutrition bar are to be suspended indefinitely. The manpower from these other projects will be redistributed to the development of these new weapons.
Interactability_Text_Line_5 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_6 It will likely be unprofitable to indefinitely suspend our other projects, but during times like these, the survival of France- and humanity- is more important than Rula's financial situation.
