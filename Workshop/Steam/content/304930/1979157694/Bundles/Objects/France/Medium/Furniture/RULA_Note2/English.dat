Name Rula Note - Food

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Rula Operations Log: Jan. 11
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 We have run out of fresh food in about a month, and without any food resupply shipments we won't have any fresh food anytime soon. I've tried to ask the hydroponics for some fresh produce, but they are so religious about using every bit of it for those weird food bars.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_4 The staff has grown tired of canned food, and they seem to prefer canned food over the nutrition bars. I'm simply out of options, and I hope they understand that.
