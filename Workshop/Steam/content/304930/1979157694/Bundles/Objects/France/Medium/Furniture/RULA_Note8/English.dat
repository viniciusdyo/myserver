Name Rula Note - Focus Variants

Interactability_Text_Line_0 Rula Development Log: Jan. 25
Interactability_Text_Line_1 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_2 E-564 design has gone well, and the flaws from XE-564 have been ironed out. As a result, general accuracy has been improved and the capacitors recharge faster. The E-564 also features a new holographic sight instead of primitive iron sights.
Interactability_Text_Line_3 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_4 Two interesting developments have come from the E-564 improvements. The XE-530 project, despite being closed down, had an incredible improvement of efficiency using E-564 hardware. The XE-530 has a startling 97% efficiency, using the same power cell! Being able to have so much firepower from the same power cell is incredible, and XE-530 has been designated to E-530 as a result. E-530 has experienced some charging issues, so it cannot fire very fast at the moment. The 97% efficiency alone makes the E-530 competitive compared to E-564, which only has 76%
Interactability_Text_Line_5 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_6 The other development is a derivative of E-564. The overall size of the weapon was shortened and the capacitor configuration was changed. The weapon fired much faster, but suffered from high strain and a horrid 53% efficiency. However, this new derivative is compact, and may have use in the future for situations where the size of the E-564 or E-530 would be detrimental. This new derivative has been designated as E-570.
Interactability_Text_Line_7 ----------------------------------
Interactability_Text_Line_8 These new "Focus" weapon variants will allow the new energy weapon to fill more niches within the French Army.
